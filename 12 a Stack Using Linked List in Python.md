# Ex.No 12.a Stack Using Linked List in Python

This project demonstrates a basic stack implementation in Python using list methods to mimic linked list behavior. It includes stack operations like **push**, **display**, **peek**, and **pop**.

## AIM

To Type and display all the elements inserted and also display after deleting one element. 

## ALGORITHM

1. Start  
2. Create a stack  
3. Append (push) elements to the stack
4. Delete the last element inserted using pop()
5. Print the elements of the stack  
6. Stop

## PROGRAM

```python

# Name: Mohamed Jafin
# Reg.No: 212223020018

stack = []

stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')

print("Stack after elements are pushed:")
print(stack)

print("Deleting the last element inserted:")
print(stack.pop())

print("Stack after elements are popped:")
print(stack)
```
