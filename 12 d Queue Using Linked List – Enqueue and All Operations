# 12 d Queue Using Linked List â€“ Enqueue and All Operations

## Aim

To write a Python program to add 4 elements to a queue and print the elements present at the front and rear of the queue.

## Algorithm

1. Start  
2. Create a queue  
3. Append elements to the queue  
4. Print the front and rear elements in the queue  
5. Stop

## Program

```python
## Reg no:212223020020
## Name: Pradaksha V
queue = []

# Enqueue elements into the queue
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
queue.append('d')

# Display the initial queue
print('Initial Queue:', queue)

# Print front and rear elements
print("\nElement at the front of the queue is", queue[0])
print("\nElement at the rear of the queue is", queue[-1])
```
